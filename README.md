# Salt Tortilla

A minimal **HTTP client** to test your APIs straight from your CLI. No need to memorize al the cURL commands or have a bloated desktop app like Postman or Insomnia, when all you want is to check if your API responds correctly to user input.

## Technologies used

It has been built using [Go](https://go.dev) with the addition of the [Bubble tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).

## Roadmap

- [ ] Include *Headers* in the request
- [ ] Include *Body* in the request
- [ ] Multiple requests in one *session*
- [ ] Automatize sending *cookies*
- [x] `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE` HTTP verbs available
